Machine Learning
=================
1. d. All of the above
2. d. None
3. c. Reinforcement learning and Unsupervised learning
4. b. The tree representing how close the data points are to each other
5. d. None
6. c. k-nearest neighbour is same as k-means
7. d. 1, 2 and 3
8. a. 1 only
9. a. 2
10. b. Given a database of information about your users, automatically group them into different market segments.
11. a
12. b
13. Clustering is important because it is usually used to classify data into structures that are more easily understood and manipulated. It is grouping a set of objects so that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups
14. a) K-means clustering algorithm can be significantly improved by using a better initialization technique, and by repeating (re-starting) the algorithm.
	b) When the data has overlapping clusters, k-means can improve the results of the initialization technique.

STATISTICS
===========
1. b) Total Variation = Residual Variation + Regression Variation
2. c) binomial
3. a) 2
4. b) Type-II error
5. b) Size of the test
6. b) Increase
7. b) Hypothesis
8. d) All of the mentioned
9. a) 0
10 Bayes' Theorem: P(A|B) =  P(A) P(B|A)P(B)
	Which tells us:	 	how often A happens given that B happens, written P(A|B),
	When we know:	 	how often B happens given that A happens, written P(B|A)
 	 	and how likely A is on its own, written P(A)
 	 	and how likely B is on its own, written P(B)
11. Z-Score: A z-score describes the position of a raw score in terms of its distance from the mean, when measured in standard deviation units
	Formula: z = (score - mean)/SD
12. t-test: It is a statistical test that is used to compare the means of two groups
13. Percentile indicate the percentage of scores that fall below a particular value
14. (ANOVA): Analysis of variance is an analysis tool used in statistics that splits an observed aggregate variability found inside a data set into two parts: systematic factors and random factors.
15. ANOVA is useful when analyzing the multi-item scales common in market research. Testing t-test three or more variables
